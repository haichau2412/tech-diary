# Understanding Catch-All Segments in Next.js

Next.js is well-known for its intuitive file-based routing system. One of the most powerful features of that system is the **catch-all segment**.

In this article, we‚Äôll break down what catch-all segments are, how to use them, and what common mistakes to avoid.

---

## üß† What Is a Catch-All Segment?

A catch-all segment is a dynamic route in Next.js that matches **any number of path segments**.

For example:

```txt
/pages/docs/[...slug].tsx
```

This single file will match:

- `/docs`
- `/docs/getting-started`
- `/docs/guides/setup/windows`

The key is the `[...]` syntax. It tells Next.js to capture **everything after the base path** and store it as an array.

---

## üîç Accessing the Segments

When you define a catch-all route, the matched segments are passed into the page‚Äôs `params`.

```tsx
export default function Page({ params }) {
  return <div>{JSON.stringify(params.slug)}</div>;
}
```

If the URL is `/docs/guides/setup`, `params.slug` will be:

```js
["guides", "setup"]
```

---

## üéØ Optional Catch-All Segments

You can also make the segment optional:

```txt
/pages/docs/[[...slug]].tsx
```

This matches:

- `/docs`
- `/docs/anything/here`
- `/docs/even/deeper/paths`

The extra `[]` around the spread tells Next.js this route should also match the base path.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases for Catch-All Segments

Catch-all segments are perfect for:

- Documentation pages
- Blog categories and nested slugs
- CMS-powered routes
- User-generated URLs (e.g. forums, multi-tenant apps)

---

## üß™ Example: CMS-Powered Blog

Let‚Äôs say your CMS provides blog paths like:

- `/blog/tech/javascript`
- `/blog/tech/react/hooks`
- `/blog/lifestyle/productivity`

Create a catch-all route:

```txt
/pages/blog/[...slug].tsx
```

You can now use the `slug` array to load the appropriate content.

```tsx
const path = params.slug.join('/');
const post = await fetchPostByPath(path);
```

## üß± Table: [slug] vs [...slug] vs [[...slug]]

| Route Segment     | Matches                | Slug Result             |
|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| `[slug]`          | `/blog/react`          | `"react"`               |
| `[...slug]`       | `/blog/react/hooks`    | `["react", "hooks"]`    |
| `[[...slug]]`     | `/blog` and deeper     | `undefined` or array    |

---

## ‚ùó Common Mistakes to Avoid

> ‚ÄúCatch-all segments are powerful, but easy to misuse.‚Äù

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Mistake 1: Using `[slug]` instead of `[...slug]`

`[slug]` only matches a single segment. If you need to match nested paths, you need the spread syntax.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Mistake 2: Not checking for `undefined`

If you're using `[[...slug]]`, remember that `params.slug` can be `undefined`.

## üßæ Summary

- Catch-all segments let you match multiple path segments using `[...slug]`.
- Optional segments use `[[...slug]]` and match the base path too.
- You can build powerful CMS, docs, and multi-level apps with this feature.
- Be mindful of how you handle undefined and path depth.
