        NextJS is currently a popular framework because it uses React internally
        and supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & and Search Engine
        Optimization (SEO). I&apos;ve chosen it as my next target for learning.
        Even though my portfolio doesn&apos;t need SSR, since it relies heavily
        on JS and user interaction, I still choose it to gain experience and
        deepen my knowledge. This decision is focused on improving my skills on
        the frontend side.

        For the backend, I want to start with something standard, so I&apos;ve
        chosen Express. Initially, I intend to opt out framework when starting
        to learning BE. Although this approach may take a longer time to
        implement things, it helps in the long run, as it forces me to
        thoroughly understand BE key concepts and integrate them into my BE
        manually, rather than relying on boilerplate code provided by
        frameworks.
